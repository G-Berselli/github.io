abstract = {This paper reports about project-based learning activities carried out within the course of Design ofAutomatic Machines at the University ofGenova. This didactic experience, provided to the students enrolled in the second-level degree in Mechanical Engineering, aims at providing the knowledge of those methods and tools required to optimally design functional parts of automatic machines, here including the mechanical architecture and the actuation sub- system. Lecture hours are equally devoted to the introduction of theoretical concepts and to lab exercises, which leverage on the extensive and advanced use of dedicated CAD/CAE software tools (i.e. PTC Creo). In particular, the pro- jects are related to the in-depth study of automated packaging systems, initial (sub-optimal) design solutions being provided by an industrial partner with years of practice in the sector. After a description of the educational goals, the presentation discusses the phases of the activity and the main methodological aspects. In addition, the adopted tools for the design and simulation of the developed systems are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. The paper presents the third version of the hybrid leg-wheel ground mobile robot Mantis, a small-scale platform designed for inspection and surveillance tasks. The locomotion system is based on the cooperating action of a couple of actuated front legs and wheels, along with a passive rear carriage. The system performs wheeled locomotion on even grounds and hybrid locomotion in case of terrain irregularities or obstacles. This architecture combines high speed, energy efficiency, maneuverability and stable camera vision on flat terrains with good motion capabilities in unstructured environments. In the embodiment design presented hereafter, referred to as Mantis 3.0, the rear carriage has been equipped with four passive wheels, instead of two as in the previous versions, in order to improve the stability during steep stair climbing maneuvers; moreover, the legs, the main body and the rear carriage have been significantly redesigned in order to be realized by additive manufacturing techniques, with the final aim of obtaining a low-cost device suitable for Open Source distribution.},

The method thus affords high computation speed, while retaining the exactness and generic nature of the results.

abstract = {According to recent researches, it is desirable to extend Industrial Ro- bots (IR) applicability to strategic fields such as heavy and/or fine deburring of customized parts with complex geometry. In fact, from a conceptual point of view, anthropomorphic manipulators could effectively provide an excellent alternative to dedicated machine tools (lathes, milling machines, etc.), by being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (20-50{\%} cost reduction as compared to traditional CNC machining). Nonetheless, in order to successfully enable high- quality Robotic Deburring (RD), it is necessary to overcome the intrinsic robot limitations (e.g. reduced structural stiffness, backlash, time-consuming process planning/optimization) by means of suitable design strategies and additional engi- neering tools. Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to present recent advances in design methods and software platforms for RD effective exploitation. Focusing on offline methods for robot programming, two novel approaches are described. On one hand, practical design guidelines (devised via a DOE method) for optimal IR positioning within the robotic workcell are presented. Secondly, a virtual prototyping technique for simulating a class of passively compliant spin- dles is introduced, which allows for the offline tuning of the RD process parame- ters (e.g. feed rate and tool compliance). Both approaches are applied in the design of a robotic workcell for high-accuracy deburring of aerospace turbine blades.},

abstract = {We present a kinematic analysis algorithm for mechanisms built of rigid parts, such as door locks, gearboxes, and transmissions. The algorithm produces a concise and complete description of the kinematics of a mechanism. It optimizes the computation by decomposing complex mechanisms into subassemblies, deriving the kinematics of the subassemblies, and incrementally composing the results. We define a class of mechanisms for which kinematic analysis is feasible by restricting the shapes, motions, and interactions of parts. The feasible class contains linkages, mechanisms whose parts move along fixed spatial axes, and combinations of the two types. We show that the feasible class covers most mechanisms by surveying 2500 mechanisms from an engineering encyclopedia. We implement the kinematic analysis algorithm for fixed-axes mechanisms. The inputs are the shapes and initial configurations of the parts. The output is a region diagram, a partition of the mechanism configuration space into regions that characterize its operating modes. The program computes the region diagram by identifying motion axes and interacting pairs of parts, partitioning the pairwise configuration spaces, and composing them. Coupling the program with existing linkage analysis packages covers most feasible mechanisms. We identify classes of infeasible mechanisms and describe possible analysis strategies for them. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

A constant high quality requires accurate 3D surface contouring operations with engineered tool compliance and cutting power. Moreover, aeronautic cast part production is characterized by small lot sizes with high variability of geometries and defects. Despite robots are conceived to provide the necessary flexibility, reconfigurability and efficiency, most robotic workcells are very limited by too long programming and setup times, especially at changeover. The paper reports a design method dealing with the integrated development of process and production system, and analyzes and compares a CAD-based and a digitizer-based offline programming strategy. The deburring of gear transmission housings for aerospace applications serves as a severe test field. The strategies are compared by the involved costs and times, learning easiness, production downtimes and machining accuracy. The results show how the reconfigurability of the system together with the exploitation of offline programming tools improves the robotic deburring process. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

The first part of the chapter presents alternative design approaches for articulated joints and finger structures based on purposely designed compliant hinges. The basic problem of compliant hinges adoption in robotic structures, that is the limitation ofsecondary compliance effects, is analyzed and considerations about comparative metrics are proposed. Two hinge morphologies which show promising features are critically compared and pros and cons the production of fully integral fingers with compliant joints are discussed. The second part reports on the development of thin soft covers for robotic (and prosthetic) hands capable of strictly mimicking the actual compliance of human finger pulps. A design method, called by the authors Differentiated Layer Design (DLD), is reviewed and its potential for application on both robotic and prosthetic devices is underlined. Conclusions summarize the main aspects that encourage the transfer of the described results from the world of robots to that ofhuman portable devices.},

abstract = {Actuators based on Dielectric Elastomer films have been rising as a promising technology in robotic and mechatronic applications. Their overall behavior is highly influenced by the geometry and structural properties of the frame that is coupled with the active film. In this paper, a compound-structure compliant frame is proposed with the aim of obtaining an actuator capable of providing a quasi-constant force over a certain range of motion. A diamond shaped frame, designed to support the pre-stretched active film, is coupled with a delta shaped element, designed to modify the overall actuator stiffness and improve its performance. Both the diamond and the delta element are fully compliant mechanisms whose main structural parameters are calculated using pseudo-rigid-body models and then verified through finite element analysis. Simulations show promising performance of the proposed actuator. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
